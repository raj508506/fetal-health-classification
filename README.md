Fetal Health Classification Using Machine Learning
This project focuses on classifying fetal health status using various machine learning techniques. It aims to help medical professionals identify potential health risks in fetuses based on cardiotocography data.

**Project Overview**
**Objective**: Predict fetal health status (Normal, Suspect, or Pathological) based on features derived from cardiotocography exams.
**Dataset**: The dataset contains features such as fetal heart rate, uterine contractions, and fetal movement, which are key indicators of fetal health.
**Algorithms Used:**
Logistic Regression
Random Forest
KNeighborsClassifier
**Key Features**
**Data Preprocessing**: Handled missing data, normalization, and feature scaling.
**Model Evaluation**: Used accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices for evaluation.
**Hyperparameter Tuning**: Applied Grid Search/Random Search for optimizing model performance.
**Visualization**: Included charts to explain the correlation between features and health status.
**Results**
Achieved an accuracy of 88% with the best-performing model.
